# pycharm-Flight-Ticket
This code snippet defines variables for a trip, specifying the departure city (From_), destination city (To), and the ticket price (ticket_price). It then prints a formatted message showing the trip details, including the cities and ticket cost, e.g., "from Las Vegas to Maryland is $425.5".
